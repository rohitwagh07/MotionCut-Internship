## Creating a Registration Form

## Design Choices

I wanted to create an aesthetically pleasing registration form with a stylish glassmorphism design. Here were some of my key design choices:

* Used a full background image with the form centered on top to create an immersive experience
* Styled the form with glassmorphism using semi-transparent whites and blurred backdrop filters to give a slick look
* Made the form glow subtly against the background using box shadows and borders
* Used clean sans-serif fonts and gave elements bolding and coloring for good information hierarchy

## Features

In terms of functionality, I included some standard registration form features:

* :fontawesome-solid-user: Username field 
* :fontawesome-solid-envelope: Email field
* :fontawesome-solid-lock: Password field
* :fontawesome-solid-check: Submit button

I made sure to:

* Use appropriate input types like email and password 
* Add the `required` attribute for validation
* Give inputs placeholder text as hints for users

## Challenges

Some challenges I ran into:

* Getting the glassmorphism styling right - took some tweaking with transparencies  
* Centering the form perfectly on all screen sizes - flexbox saved the day
* Restricting the background image from scrolling - used `height: 100vh`

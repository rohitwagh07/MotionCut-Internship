# Week 1 Task of creating Pricing Landing Page

# Pricing Page Design Choices

## Overall Design and Layout

I chose to use Bootstrap for the overall design and layout to make the page responsive easily across devices. Key choices:

- Container and rows for layout using Bootstrap grid system 
- Header, main, and footer sections for clean separation
- Image on left and details on right in main section for visual appeal

## Features

Key features added:

- Dynamic pricing based on plan, currency etc using JS
- Image change on color option select using JS
- Unit changes on unit system select using JS
- Clean unordered list for feature highlights  
- Select boxes for options to pick plan, color etc

These features enhance user experience and interaction.

## Challenges 

Some challenges faced:

- Getting price update logic with currency exchange rates right 
- Updating image source correctly on select change
- Ensuring responsiveness across devices

Solved these by:

- Carefully working through different scenarios like how will it look on mobile devices.
- Using a switch statement to pick image name
- Adding media queries based on Bootstrap
